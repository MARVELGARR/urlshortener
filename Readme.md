### What I learned

During this challenge, I practiced using local storage to add and delete individual items. I learned that local storage can be a useful tool for storing data that needs to persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed. By utilizing the localStorage object in JavaScript, I was able to store and retrieve data easily.

In addition, I also improved my skills working with APIs. I learned how to make HTTP requests and parse JSON data in order to retrieve and display information from an external API. This allowed me to add dynamic functionality to my application and create a more engaging user experience.

Overall, this challenge helped me deepen my understanding of both local storage and API integration. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and continuing to improve as a developer.
